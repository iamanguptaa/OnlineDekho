			<p class="intro1" id="intro1">Law is a system of rules that are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior.</p>
			<p class="intro1">Laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or by judges through binding precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.</p>
			<p class="intro1">Legal education in the India generally refers to the education of lawyers before entry into practice. Legal education in India is offered at different levels by the traditional universities and the specialised law universities and schools only after completion of an undergraduate degree or as an integrated degree.</p>

				The law is important because it serves as a norm of conduct for citizens and residents. It acts as a guideline for acceptable behavior, and ensures equality within communities and social groups by an outline for the consequences of law violations. Laws communicate what is accepted in each society. 
				<br><br>
				Indian constitution state education is everyone’s birthright. But unfortunately some people oppose the idea on account of their personal financial gain or something else maybe. Laws are there to protect the victims of such heinous acts. The government institutes are obliged to produce basic education to children absolutely free of cost.				
				<br><br>
				Laws protect the rights of everyone. There might be some instance when someone feels violated in terms of ethics in an educational institute. The laws are there to protect you and deliver justice.
