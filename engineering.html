			<p class="intro1" id="intro1">Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.</p>
			<p class="intro1">The discipline of engineering is extremely broad and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied science, technology and types of application.</p>
			<p class="intro1">The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation or safety to life and property.</p>

			<div class="c1">
			<p>If you are curious about how things work and have a keen mind for applying what you learn to solve real world problems, engineering is the perfect avenue for your talents. Be prepared to dedicate years of learning and practice to master a field of engineering; don’t expect to build an A380 airbus or the next Burj Khalifa (currently the tallest building in the world) within a year of completing your degree, but trust that eventually you could work on a fulfilling and exciting project later in your career.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="c2">
				<p>The skills that you develop as an engineer are incredibly valuable and highly sought after.People will turn to you to help solve problems for them since this is your bread and butter skill. The ability to provide practical solutions to problems is crucial and will give you great confidence when faced with any challenge or obstacle. You will develop an understanding of the feasibility of a project from a financial and practical perspective. You also learn how to manage your time effectively, work as a part of a team and develop into a true leader. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="c3">
				<p>
					As an engineer you will rank amongst the highest paid professions in the world, even as a graduate. Your unique, universal skill set will enable you to work in almost any country in the world (and beyond!). Not many careers offer this sort of opportunity to gain experience and explore new cultures and lifestyles. Engineers working in multinational companies will often travel overseas for conferences and to visit or inspect company facilities, adding variety to their daily routines.

				Admissions in the UG and PG engineering courses is done through entrance examination. The admission to undergraduate programs of all the NITs and other reputed engineering colleges  is done through Joint Entrance Examination Main (JEE Main). For admission to IITs (Indian Institute of Technology), students have to appear the JEE Advanced.
			</p>
			<p class="adm_con">
				Some states also organize their own entrance test for providing admission to B.Tech programme. Some state level entrance exams are BCECE conducted by Bihar state, JCECE conducted by Jharkhand state, TS EAMCET by Telangana state, AP EAMCET of Andhra Pradesh state.
			</p>
			<p class="adm_con">
				If you want to take admission in M.Tech programme, then you have to appear the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Some state level entrance test are also conducted for M.Tech admission like AP PGECET, TANCET, CUCET, etc.
