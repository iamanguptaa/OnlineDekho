				A career in defence makes a person not only disciplined and strong but also opens up many other avenues for growth. Defence personnel are extensively trained in combat, usage of different kinds of weaponry and are equipped to handle the security of anything, from a club to the whole country.
				<br><br>
				Soldiers, with guns slung on their shoulders, smartly dressed in army uniforms, marching like machine men, heads held high and eyes blazing with unshakable confidence. This is what a career in defence usually surmises. The only difference is: you may be wielding any weapon ranging from an automatic rifle to ballistic missiles, commanding a small group of commandos or leading a squadron of fighter jets in the blazing skies. The main characteristic, however, remains the same: an eye to eye confrontation with enemy forces and challenges that no ordinary man can take up.
				A career in defence turns a person into a hero, a literal hero. It all starts when recruits undergo a training course which trains their bodies as well as their minds to face any challenge, combat any threat and overcome any pressure. The training converts a common person into a brave, agile and fearless soldier.
