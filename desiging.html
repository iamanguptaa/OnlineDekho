			<p class="intro1" id="intro1">Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns).[1] Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be design..</p>
			<p class="intro1">Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes, and even methods or processes of designing</p>
			<p class="intro1">Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context. It is an act of creativity and innovation.</p>

				While the spoon is a very basic example, the complex artifacts that humans make today invariably involve engineering design. The Worli Sea link in Mumbai, the fastest car in the world, the supersonic jets, smart phones, the Burj Khalifa and the latest innovation in diagnostic medicine - all are examples of engineering design at work.Thus, the prime purpose of engineering design is to apply scientific knowledge to the solution of technical problems.
			
				<br><br>
				The process of design is useful not only for building great products, services, or solutions, but also for pursuing a more creative and open-minded approach to life. Design behaviors – collaboration, empathy towards others, prototyping new ideas, and continuous improvement – are important when delving into any new experience.

				"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition.Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that’s why it is so complicated"
