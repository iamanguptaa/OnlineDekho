			<p class="intro1">A study conducted in 2011 that involved more than 1000 medical schools throughout the world indicated on average, 64 university exams, 130 series exams, and 174 assignments are completed over the course of 5.5 years. Students need more than 85% marks in prerequisite courses in order to get enrolled for the aptitude test for these degree programs. They then have to pass the test with 85% to 90% marks, which is high compared with all the other bachelor's degree programs.[1] The World Health Organization has granted international recognition to certain widely offered conventional medical degrees. Degrees recognized internationally by the AVICENNA Directory for medicine/International Medical Education Directory.</p>

				"The ability to help people directly and make them happier" <br><br>
				Most doctors would say that there is no greater joy than the one you feel when you manage to help a very sick patient or when you are part of a group of scientists who discover a new medicine for a certain disease. The ability to directly help the healing process is also a continuous challenge and sometimes it is not easy to cope with it. For this reason, your medical education will prepare you to handle the difficult moments and land on your feet in 99% of the cases.
			
				<br><br>
				All over the world, there is a great uniformity of medical science knowledge and practice. This means that by graduating from a medical college in Europe you can find a job and work in any hospital in South America or anywhere else in the world. Something inaccessible to many other disciplines. Furthermore, the largest part of medical literature is in English and most of the basic medical terms are in Latin. You will get acquainted with English and Latin during your studies so that words like vertebrae or patella will be general knowledge to you and to a doctor on the other side of the world.

				The All India Pre-Medical test/ Pre-Dental Entrance Test (AIPMT now replaced by NEET-UG)[1] was an annual medical entrance examination in India.[2] The exam was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Delhi for admission to MBBS and BDS courses in several medical colleges across the country. 15% of the total seats in all medical and dental colleges run by the Union of India, state governments, municipal or other local authorities in India, except in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Jammu and Kashmir, were reserved for candidates who qualified this examination.

			<p class="adm_con">
				The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a computer-based standardized examination for prospective medical students in the United States, Australia,[9] Canada, and Caribbean Islands. It is designed to assess problem solving, critical thinking, written analysis and knowledge of scientific concepts and principles. Prior to August 19, 2006, the exam was a paper-and-pencil test. Since January 27, 2007, however, all administrations of the exam have been computer-based.
