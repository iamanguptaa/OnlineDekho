                   The candidate should fall within the category-wise top 20 percentile of successful candidates in his/her respective Class XII (or equivalent) board examination.
                   The candidate should have secured 75% (for GEN or OBC-NCL) or 70% (SC, ST or PwD) of aggregate marks in the Class XII (or equivalent) board examination.

                <h4>JEE Advanced 2017 exam eligibility entails that candidates clear Paper-1 of JEE Main 2017.  The dates for the exam will be released soon. <br><br>Candidates who wish to take this exam have to fulfill certain criteria as fixed by JAB. Thus, the eligibility criteria for JEE Advanced 2017 is as follows:
                </h4>
                <h3>I- Performance in JEE Main 2017</h3>
                <h4>Candidates who fall among the top 2,20,000 rankers in JEE Main 2017 across all categories are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced. Out of this number, the percentage of candidates eligible for admissions under different categories are as follows:
                <br><br>
                General category candidates (from the common merit list) – 50.5% <br>
                OBC-NCL candidates – 27%<br>
                SC candidates – 15% <br>
                ST candidates – 7.5%<br>
                Pwd candidates - Horizontal reservation of 3% in all the above categories</h4>
                <h3>II-Age Limit</h3>
                <h4>Age limit for JEE Advanced for General or OBC-NCL category candidates states that aspirants will be eligible to apply for the entrance exam if they are born on or after October 1, 1992. However, age limit for SC, ST or PwD category candidates states that such aspirants should be born on or after October 1, 1986.</h4>
                <h3>III-Number of Attempts</h3>
                <h4>The exam eligibility for JEE Advanced 2017 states that candidates would be able appear for this engineering entrance exam a maximum of two times in his/her lifetime. Here, candidates also require to ensure that they appear for this entrance exam in consecutive years. To explain this further, if a candidate wants to appear for JEE Advanced then this attempt should either be his/her first attempt and if not so, then this should 
                be his/her second consecutive attempt.</h4>
                <h3>IV – Appearance in Class XII (or equivalent) examination</h3>
                <h4>Candidates can appear for this engineering entrance exam if they have appeared for their Class XII or equivalent exam in 2016 or 2017. Here, candidates also need to ensure that this should be their first attempt in all the subjects they have opted in Class XII or equivalent.
                <br><br>
                The exam eligibility for JEE Advanced also lists that candidates who have appeared for their Class XII or equivalent examination in 2016 and thereafter want to re-appear for the same examination in 2017 for any reason – whether it is for improvement of score/marks or if they have failed in one or more subjects, then in such a scenario, candidates have to re-appear in all the subjects (of their Class XII or equivalent examination) in 2017.
                 <br><br>
                Also, candidates who attempted their Class XII (or equivalent) examination for the first time in 2015 or earlier will not meet the exam eligibility criteria. But, those candidates whose Class XII or equivalent exam Board results for the academic year 2014-2015 were declared after June 2015 would be eligible to appear for the exam.
                 </h4>      
                <h3>V – Earlier admission at IITs/ISM</h3>
                <h4>JEE Advanced 2017 eligibility criteria mentions that a candidate can only appear for the exam if he/she had not taken admission earlier at any of the 19 IITs and ISM, this critreion also holds true even if the candidate took admission and did not continue with their admission in the programme on offer at any of the 19 IITs and ISM.
                  <br><br>
                Candidate are disqualified from appearing for the exam if it is brought to notice that they in the past had paid the admission fee for any course at IITs or ISM through JEE Advanced.
                 <br><br>
                Another eligibility criteria for JEE Advanced on the basis of which a candidate’s application can be rejected is if their admission was cancelled by the board/institute earlier.
                 <br><br>
                However, candidates are eligible to appear for it if they have been granted admission in any of the preparatory courses on offer (at any of the IITs) in 2016.</h4>
